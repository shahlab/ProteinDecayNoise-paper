# GFP-timelapse:

The zipped files contain raw image files from timelapse experiments described in the paper "xxx".

## Description of the Data and file structure

Following is the description of the file names contained in the zipped folders:

Each file in the raw zipped folder has the following naming structure:

[GFP]\_[experiment type]\_[timelapse duration]\_[attempt]\_[channel]\_[field of view]\_[timelapse series no.].TIF

[GFP] = type of GFP strain either 8hr = yeGFP, 30mgfp = yeGFP-CLN2, 20mgfp = yeGFP-mODC;

[experiment type] = tl == timelapse [timelapse duration] == 20mins

[attempt] == 1,2,3

[channel] = "w1BF-PH" == DIC images

"w2TxRed" == fluorescent (fl) images of Pup1-tDimer in Texas red channel "w3GFP "== GFP fl images, "w4UV FL"== Hoechst 333xx fl images for DNA stain [field of view] == s1:s8 correspond to individual fields of view. s1,s2: Autofluorescent control (SDY010 strain) s3,s4: two fields of view from biological replicate 1. s5,s6: two fields of view from biological replicate 2. s7,s8: two fields of view from biological replicate 3.

[timelpase series no.] = t1:t31: describes timelapse image no. from 1 through 31. Following is the description of the files contained in the zipped folders: ###06-28-22-modc-pup1.tar.gz raw timelapse images for cells expressing yeGFP-mODC in SDY011 strain. ###7-20-22-cln2.tar.gz" raw timelapse images for cells expressing yeGFP-CLN2 in SDY011 strain.
